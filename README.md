**OPUS** (**O**bservatoire de **P**aris **U**WS **S**ystem) is a job control 
system developed using the micro-framework bottle.py. The Universal Worker System 
pattern v1.1 (UWS) as defined by the International Virtual Observatory Alliance 
(IVOA) is implemented as a REST service to control job execution on a work cluster.
OPUS also follows the proposed IVOA Provenance Data Model to capture and expose 
the provenance information of jobs and results.
